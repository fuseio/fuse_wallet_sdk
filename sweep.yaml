# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create a pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "All new business logic should have corresponding unit tests."
  - "Refactor large functions to be more modular."
  - "Update the README.md file whenever a new feature is added. Make sure to include a description of the feature and any new commands."
  - "There should be no debug log or print statements in production code."
  - "Any clearly inefficient or repeated code should be optimized or refactored."
  - "Remove any comments before code that are obvious. For example `# this prints hello world; print('hello world')`."

# This is the branch that Sweep will develop from and make pull requests to. Most people use 'main' or 'master' but some users also use 'dev' or 'staging'.
branch: "dev"

# By default Sweep will read the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions. To disable this, set this to false.
gha_enabled: false

# This is the description of your project. It will be used by sweep when creating PRs. You can tell Sweep what's unique about your project, what frameworks you use, or anything else you want.
